## About Me 

I'm a postdoc in industrial-organizational psychology that works in the Washington, DC area. 

My primary tool for analysis is R, but I have expreience with SQL and to a lesser extent python. As a psychologist by training, I'm partial to the psych package for exploratory data analysis but use packages from the tidyverse to wrangle and clean my data.

My most common methods involve testing linear models, modelling structural equations, and factor analysis.
